# Project Idea ?

# Detecting Credit Card Fraud In light of the increasing number of customers using credit cards, as well as their information in the bank system, the bank must provide a good protection system.

# After a lot of research, they found that there is no alternative to entering Machine learning into the security system. This is a large number of customers and their information, but the model has gone through many stages in order to reach what we want and these stages are now clear with us

# The Project Goal ?

# The goal of the project Here is two sides of the same coin, that is, to provide protection for the bank as well as the customer.

# This is done by :

# Protecting the customer from any fraud or hacking to preserve his data

# Protecting the bank from any losses in the event of any fraud

# Provides an exchange of trust between customers and the bank

# Increases the number of customers at the bank that uses the fraud against protection system

# Dataset Description ?

# It is a CSV file.

# The Dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. We have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

# It contains only numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation. Unfortunately, due to confidentiality issues, we cannot provide the original features and more background information about the data. Features V1, V2, … V28 are the principal components obtained with PCA, the only features which have not been transformed with PCA are 'Time' and 'Amount'. Feature ‘Time’ contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. The feature ‘Amount’ is the transaction Amount
